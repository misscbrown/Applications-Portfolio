          <p>Mad about music and tech! Even better when the two are combined, working towards
              becoming a full stack developer using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I've built a few
              cool applications which you can check out below. Always keen to network, learn new 
              things and meet new people. Working towards building a marketplace allowing artists
              to sell shares in their music via NFT's.
