Portfolio of completed applications

Description:
A website that showcases the applications I have built, during my time on the bootcamp. Includes 5 projects, header with nav bar that links to sections of my work, short bio with picture, my email and other contact details. I styled the elements using CSS with code written in HTML. The page is mobile responsive and each image links to the corresponding application.
